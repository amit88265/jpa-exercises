Answer
1.Tried @tableGenerator strategy.
2.We need it as to determine next id and to create batch of ids.
3.Sequence uses database to store next used value.
4.SEQUENCE IS BEST AS IT IS FAST.
5.long should be used for most of the places as it fast and take less space.
 use uuid when we need to store info in id or we have less database operation between table.
