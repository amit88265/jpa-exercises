5. Did hibernate created mapping table?
6. What will happen if we remove `CascadeType.PERSIST` attribute in `department` field of `Employee` class? Why it happens?
7. How can we ensure no employee is created without department?
8. What code you will write to create two employees John and Tom associated with IT department?
9. Which of the two entities is the owning side and which of the two is the inverse side?
10. How can you change name of the join column from `department_id` to `dept_id`?

#Answer
1. Three tables are created viz.
  a.Department
  b.Hibernate_sequence
  c.Employee

2. Structure of employees table is:
      id bigint(20) , name varchar(255), salary bigint(20), department_id bigint(20)

3.Structure of departments table:
       id bigint(20), name varchar(255)

4. hibernate insert department first and then employee. It is because when it tries to insert an Employee
 it will encounter a relationship between these two tables and will see if there is related object  in department or
  not if not it will insert in department first and then in employee.

5.no

6.If we remove CascadeTypes.PERSIST then an error will occur saying that object is in transient state which is not saved
. IT happens as that object is related to employee table while inserting employee it will look for department object
and it found that object is not in table but in an unsaved state.

7.By making NOT_NULL CONSTRAINT on department_id in employee in @JoinColumn.

8.Employee employee1 = new Employee();

              employee1.setName("John");
              employee1.setSalary(200_000);
              employee1.setDepartment(department);
              entityManager.persist(employee1);

              Employee employee2 = new Employee();
              employee2.setName("Tom");
              employee2.setSalary(300_000);
              employee2.setDepartment(department);
              entityManager.persist(employee2);

 9. Owning side is Employee entity. There is no inverse side here as it unidirectional.

 10.Like this
   @JoinColumn(name = "dept_id")
  on department field of Employee.
